NET-DISPLAY:  Print network parameters and/or hyperparameters.

Net-display prints the parameters (weights, biases, and offsets)
and/or the hyperparameters (sigmas) of the network.

Usage:

    net-display [ -p | -h ] log-file [ index ]

If no index is specified, the last network in the log file is
displayed.  By default, the parameters and hyperparameters are both
displayed.  The -p option (or -w option) causes only the parameters
(weights) to be displayed (to higher precision).  The -h option (or -s
option) causes only the hyperparameters (sigmas) to be displayed.

The output of the program consists of one section for each type of
parameter, plus a section for noise levels, if a regression data model
is being used.  The format of a section is best described by looking
at the section for the weights from input units to output units, which
is as follows, for a net with three input units and four output units,
when no option is specified.

  Input to Output Weights [1]

    Common-sigma Unit-sigma:  Weight Weight Weight Weight

                 Unit-sigma:  Weight Weight Weight Weight

                 Unit-sigma:  Weight Weight Weight Weight

The sigma values associated with this type of parameter are at the
left, before the colons.  The top-level sigma is at the top left;
sigmas associated with each source unit appear just to the right, on
separate lines.  After the sigma for each unit are listed the weights
out of that unit.  The sigma values associated with each weight are
not displayed (neither are they explicitly represented in the file).
The number in square brackets at the end of the title is the group
number, useful in net-plt.

For biases and offsets, this basic format is modified, since the
unit-level sigma values are not explicitly represented; the common
sigma is shown in the unit sigma column instead.

When -p is specified, the format is the same, except that the sigmas
are missing, allowing the parameters to be displayed to higher precision.

When -h is specified, the format is as follows:

  Input to Output Weights [1]

    Common-sigma - Unit-sigma Unit-sigma Unit-sigma
                   Unit-sigma Unit-sigma Unit-sigma

and similarly for other groups.  This is also the format used for the
noise sigmas.
