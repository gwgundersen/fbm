EXAMPLES OF INFERENCE FOR LOCATIONS OF SOURCES OF ATMOSPHERIC CONTAMINATION.

The 'src' module is used to perform inference for models of the spread
of atmospheric contaminants from point sources.  Reference is in
src.doc and related files.  Some tutorial examples are here.  The
documentation and examples on the general operation of this package
for flexible Bayesian modeling should also be consulted.

Files containing the commands used in these examples can be found in
the 'ex-src' directory (in slightly more general form).  That
directory also has the source for some R functions and scripts for
plotting results.  Note that the 'xgraph' program (distributed via my
web page) is very useful for monitoring the progress of MCMC runs, and
for producing other plots.

The first example shows how test data can be generated from a model
with specified parameter values.  It should read first, since it
introduces the basic specification commands.  The subsequent examples
show how such data can be fitted, with either a fixed or variable
number of sources.
