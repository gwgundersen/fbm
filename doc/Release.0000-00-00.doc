NOTES ON THE VERSION OF 0000-00-00

Changes in this version.

1) New C0, C1, and Cn for n>1 quantities are now defined, to help assess
   how well metropolis and hybrid updates are exploring the distribution.

2) The maximum number of iterations that can be used when making predictions
   with the median has been increased from 200 to 1000.

Bug fixes.

1) Documentation for the 'plot' mc operation has been corrected.

Known bugs and other deficiencies.

1) The facility for plotting quantities using "plot" operations in xxx-mc
   doesn't always work for the first run of xxx-mc (before any
   iterations exist in the log file).  A work-around is to do a run of
   xxx-mc to produce just one iteration before attempting a run of
   xxx-mc that does any "plot" operations.

2) The CPU time features (eg, the "k" quantity) will not work correctly
   if a single iteration takes more than about 71 minutes.

3) The latent value update operations for Gaussian processes may recompute 
   the inverse covariance matrix even when an up-to-date version was 
   computed for the previous Monte Carlo operation.

4) Covariance matrices are stored in full, even though they are symmetric,
   which sometimes costs a factor of two in memory usage.

5) Giving net-pred several log files that have different network architectures
   doesn't work, but an error message is not always produced (the results may
   just be nonsense).

6) Some Markov chain updates for Dirichlet diffusion tree models in which 
   there is no data model (ie, no noise) are not implemented when some of 
   the data is missing.  An error message is produced in such cases.

7) The times given in the documentation for the examples are for a
   very old computer.  Typical current (2020) desktop computers will
   be at least 20 times faster.
