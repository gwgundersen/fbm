INFERENCE FOR A VARYING NUMBER OF SOURCES.

We may wish to infer not only the locations and intensities of
sources, but also their number.  Inferring the number of sources is
not a completely well-defined problem.  If sources can have very low
intensity, there could be many sources that are virtually
undetectable.  There could also be many sources located where the
available detectors cannot see their effects.  Nevertheless, as long
as these issues are kept in mind when interpreting the results,
inferring the number of sources makes sense in many situations.


A model with a an unknown number of sources can be specified by giving
a range for the number of sources in the src-spec command.  It may
also be desirable to use a non-uniform prior for source intensities
when the number of sources is unknown.  Here is an example:

    &gt; src-spec  logv2 0:5 0:5:0.5 / -10:10 -1:1 0:1

This resembles the src-spec command in the previous example
(<A HREF="Ex-src-c.html">Ex-src-c.doc</A>), except that the number of sources is now said to be
between 0 and 5, and the prior for source intensities is now written
as "0:5:0.5", which means intensities range from 0 to 5 and the
intensity raised to the power 0.5 has a uniform distribution (the
default for this power is 1).  Note that this is equivalent to the
intensity having a prior probability density proportional to the
intensity raised to the power -0.5 (and in general, a density
proportional to the intensity raised to the specified power minus 1).
Using a prior that favours small intensities may allow sources to be
added and eliminated more easily, since they are more likely to have
low intensities, and hence their presence or absence has less effect
on the fit to the data.  On the other hand, the presence of
low-intensity sources makes interpretation of the results harder.

We can leave the remaining model specifications, and the data
specification, as in the previous example (<A HREF="Ex-src-c.html">Ex-src-c.doc</A>):

    &gt; det-spec  logv2 0.01:1
    &gt; flow-spec logv2 test 1 0.08 0.0001 0.06 0.00015
    &gt; data-spec logv2 3 1 / grid2 data-grid2-0.1-1


The specification of the MCMC operations to perform each iteration
does need to be changed.  First of all, an operation that can change
the number of active sources is required.  The number of sources that
are represented in the Markov chain state is fixed at the maximum
specified with src-spec, but only the first N of these are "active",
with the remaining sources having no effect on the data distribution.
(Note that "active" here means "really exists", and is not related to
the start and stop times for sources in non-steady-state models).  The
number of active sources, N, is also part of the Markov chain state.
It is represented as a real number, N0, whose fractional part is
ignored (ie, N is the floor of N0) - an arrangement motivated by the
fact that the general MCMC routines work only on real values.

Several ways of changing N0 (and hence N) would be possible, but a
Metropolis update seems simplest.  We could add such an update,
specified by "met-1 1 N", to the operatons used in the previous
example, using the following specification command:

    &gt; mc-spec logv2 repeat 50 met-1 1 N slice-1 1 1 D slice-1 1 1 S end

However, this would be a very inefficient way to sample from the
posterior distribution.  The "slice-1 1 1 S" operation updates the
locations and intensities of active sources only, so these operations
would leave the parameters of inactive sources fixed, until such time
as they become active when N increases.  But usually N will be
unlikely to increase, since the newly active source would not have
suitable parameters values, and so a proposal to increase N will have
a low probability of acceptance.  A special "prior-gen-used" operation
has been implemented that changes the parameters of inactive sources
to values generated from their prior.  Including this operation in
mc-spec as follows would improve convergence (note that "\" is used
here to continue the command on the next line):

    &gt; mc-spec logv2 repeat 50 \
                      prior-gen-unused met-1 1 N \
                      slice-1 1 1 D slice-1 1 1 S \
                    end

Since inactive sources will now have constantly-changing parameters,
it is more likely that an increase in N will sooner-or-later be
accepted, since the parameters will sometime happen to be suitable.
However, there is still a problem with decreasing N, since the N'th
active source may be essential to fitting the data, even if one of the
earlier active sources should not really be active.  We can solve this
problem using a special operation, "shuffle", that rearranges the
order of the active sources.  With this operation added, the mc-spec
command becomes:

    &gt; mc-spec logv2 repeat 50 \
                      shuffle prior-gen-unused met-1 1 N \
                      slice-1 1 1 D slice-1 1 1 S \
                    end

If one of the active sources should not be active, "shuffle" will
sometimes make it the last active source, at which point a proposal to
decrease N may be accepted.

The above set of operations works reasonably well, but one more
elaboration may help.  The "shift-intensities" operation chooses two
active sources at random, and shifts the intensities of these two
sources while keeping their total intensity constant.  By default, it
also shifts the coordinates of the sources to keep their
intensity-weighted average the same. See <A HREF="src-mc.html">src-mc.doc</A> for details.  With
this additional operation (done 5 times), the mc-spec command becomes

    &gt; mc-spec logv2 repeat 50 \
                      shift-intensities 5 \
                      shuffle prior-gen-unused met-1 1 N \
                      slice-1 1 1 D slice-1 1 1 S \
                    end


We can now do an MCMC run with commands such as the following:

    &gt; src-initial logv2 / 1
    &gt; src-mc logv2 1000 

This takes about 20 minutes on a 3 GHz Pentium 3, and seems to be more
than enough iterations.


We can looking at the posterior distribution of the number of sources
used with the command:

    &gt; src-hist N -0.5 5.5 6 logv2 100: | plot

The number of sources is always at least three (which we know is the
correct number from how the data was generated), but is almost as
likely to be four or five as to be three.  The extra sources that are
often present usually have low intensity, as can be seen from plots
such as

    &gt; src-plt t Q1@ logv2 100: | plot-points

The src-pred and src-intensity programs can be used to predict
concentrations and to see where sources are, as in the example in
<A HREF="Ex-src-c.html">Ex-src-c.doc</A>.  See <A HREF="src-pred.html">src-pred.doc</A> and <A HREF="src-intensity.html">src-intensity.doc</A> for details.
