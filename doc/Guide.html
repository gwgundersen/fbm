GUIDE TO FURTHER DOCUMENTATION

The overview and examples above are intended just to get you started.
To use the software to do real work, you will probably need to refer
to the detailed documentation on the commands (and on the features
common to more than one command) that is contained in the files ending
with ".doc".  These files are found in the various sub-directories,
and are also all linked to from the 'doc' directory.  For quick
reference, all commands print a brief summary of the command syntax
when they are invoked with no arguments.

In the syntax descriptions used, the characters "[" and "]" enclose
parts of the command that are optional, "{" and "}" enclose optional
parts that can be repeated, and "|" separates alternatives.  Except
for the command name (or other obvious keywords), the words in the
syntax descriptions are descriptive of what is to be entered, except
that words in quotes are to be entered literally (without the quotes).

The ".doc" files present in the various directories are listed below,
with the more important files marked by "*".  Programs listed as
"xxx-something" are generic, with "xxx" being replaced by the name of
an application (eg, "net", "gp", or "mix").  In some cases, further
documentation is available under the specific name.

The file index.html is a hypertext index to this documentation.  It
can be accessed using a Web browser (eg, netscape), by opening
index.html as a local file (which will probably require giving its
full path name).  The index.html file must reside in the 'doc'
directory for this software, so that relative references will work
correctly.  The files accessed this way are .html files derived from
the .doc files.  The content is identical, except that references to
other .doc files have been converted into hypertext links that you can
follow with the browser.

The 'doc' directory also contains comments on the various software
releases, in files of the form 'Release.YYYY-MM-DD.doc'.

All the introductory documentation (including this) is collected into
the 'manual' file, as plain text.  You can print all the documentation
by going to the main directory for this software and issuing a command
such as

  lpr doc/manual util/*.doc mc/*.doc dist/*.doc bvg/*.doc \
      net/*.doc gp/*.doc mix/*.doc dft/*.doc doc/Rel*.doc
 
(or using whatever command other than 'lpr' you use to print text files).
This will produce about 200 pages of paper.
