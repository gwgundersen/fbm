BVG:  Programs demonstrating Markov chain sampling from a bivariate Gaussian.

The 'bvg' programs implement sampling from a bivariate Gaussian
distribution (or several independent replications of a bivariate
Gaussian), using the Markov chain Monte Carlo package.  This is done
primarily for testing and demonstration purposes.

The specification of the bivariate Gaussian distribution is stored in
the log file as a record of type 'B' and index -1.  The coordinates
found each iteration are stored in records of type 'X'.  The Markov
chain Monte Carlo package will of course put various other records in
the log file as well.
