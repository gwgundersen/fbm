This directory contains command and data files for demonstrations of
circular coupling (see my technical report on "Circularly-coupled
Markov chain sampling").

The ncmds.circ and mcmds.circ command files do circular coupling for
univariate standard normal and univariate mixture of normal
distributions, as in the tech report (though the results in the tech
report were actually produced with other sotware).

The ccmds.wrap and ccmds.circ command files are for the Cauchy example
in the software documentation.
