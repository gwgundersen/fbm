This directory contains data files, command files, and generation
programs for the examples of Bayesian learning for neural network and
Gaussian process models.  To play with the data as in the manual, all
you need to use are the data and command files (eg, rdata and
rcmds.net).  If you want to change the way the data was generated,
you'll need to recompile the programs, which is done with a command
such as the following:

   cc rgen.c rand.c -DRAND_FILE=\"../util/randfile\" -lm -o rgen
